# TECH: Theta EdgeCloud Hub

## Inspiration
The idea for TECH came from recognizing the potential of Theta EdgeCloud to host any Docker container and the need for a more user-friendly interface to leverage this capability. Inspired by DockerHub, we wanted to create a platform that simplifies the process of deploying and managing Docker containers, making it accessible for developers and enthusiasts across various fields.

## What it does
TECH is a frontend platform for Theta EdgeCloud that allows users to search for, browse, and deploy Docker images with ease. By integrating with Theta EdgeCloud, it supports various applications, including video, generative AI, and gaming, while also extending to other use cases. Users can quickly set up servers and manage their containers through an intuitive interface.

## How we built it
We started by exploring the capabilities of Theta EdgeCloud and DockerHub, identifying key features that would enhance the user experience. Using modern web development technologies, we built the frontend of TECH, focusing on a clean and responsive design. We integrated APIs from DockerHub and Theta EdgeCloud to enable seamless search, deployment, and management of Docker containers.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges was ensuring smooth integration between DockerHub and Theta EdgeCloud. We had to overcome technical hurdles related to API compatibility and data retrieval. We ended up using the Docker CLI to perform API queries.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of successfully creating a user-friendly interface that simplifies the deployment of Docker containers on Theta EdgeCloud. Our platform not only supports the hackathon tracks but also extends to various other applications, showcasing the versatility of Theta EdgeCloud.

## What we learned
Throughout the development process, we gained a deeper understanding of Theta EdgeCloud's capabilities and how to leverage them effectively. We also learned about the importance of user experience and the challenges of integrating multiple APIs to create a cohesive platform.

## What's next for TECH
In the future, we plan to add more advanced features to TECH, such as container monitoring, automated scaling, and enhanced security measures. We also aim to expand our user base and collaborate with the Theta community to continuously improve and innovate the platform.
